 CS108 Tetris Board.
 Represents a Tetris board -- essentially a 2-d grid
 of booleans. Supports tetris pieces and row clearing.
 Has an "undo" feature that allows clients to add and remove pieces efficiently.
 Does not do any drawing or have any idea of pixels. Instead,
 just represents the abstract 2-d board.
